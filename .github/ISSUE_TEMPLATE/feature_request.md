**Checklist**

- [ ] I read the documentation at https://chimney.readthedocs.io/ and checked that the functionality doesn't exist
- [ ] I checked the https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney/issues and haven't found the feature already requested reported
- [ ] I confirmed that the request is not related to functionality that was deprecated: lifted transformers (`TransformerF`s) or `unsafeOption` flags
- [ ] I believe that this is actual feature request, rather than [a question how to use existing features](https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney/discussions)
- [ ] I am aware of [the maintainer's announcement](https://github.com/scalalandio/chimney/discussions/762) and I understand, that this might only be implemented
      if someone from the community decide to own the feature and see it through

**Describe the desired behavior**

A clear and concise description of what would the feature provide.

**Use case example**

A snippet of code with an example how this feature could be used and for what.

**How it relates to existing features**

Would it be possible to achieve the same functionality with existing features? Does it change the existing behavior (breaking change) or adds a new one?

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the problem here.
